Remarks: 
1. the design of this website is for computer users.
2. For more cool effects and more functions in this program,
I've added and changed some design from the referenced picture. 
i.e. lyrics, play next, and position of control panel.

CSS effects:
1. stop/play button:
    User can switch between stop/play button by clicking it.
    (By using the checkbox hack)
    
2. lyrics flashing:
    Simulating the playing lyrics.
    (By using eight animation at different times) 

3. search/play/shuffle button:
    Moving curser to search button and it will change its color.
    (By using css hover)
    
4. flashing next-songs:
    Blinking the content alternatively.
    
5. left-side grey-background effect
    Moving curser to search button and it will change its color.
    (By using css hover)
